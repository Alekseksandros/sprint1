# Coding Style

The coding style should be familiar across the board, this means indentions where its needed and comments where necessary.

Example:

```
 <script>
    document.write("Hello"); # Note the indentions, this keeps the code organised
 </script>


# Only make issues when they are necessary and there is an actual problem

Ignoring the first issue to ever exist on this repo (as its an example), you should make sure that when you post an issue that it expresses an actual problem in the code
